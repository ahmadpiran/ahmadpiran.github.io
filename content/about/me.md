title: 'A Journey of Breaking and Building'
---


There is a specific satisfaction in watching a chaotic system become efficient. For me, that desire to understand how things work didn't start with servers; it started with science.

My background(My bachelor degree) is actually in Physics, a path I originally chose, at my 18s, out of a deep passion for pure science. However, I quickly realized that the university environment was heavily theoretical. I found myself bored by abstract concepts but came alive during the lab courses. I wanted to discover, touch, and test reality—not just read about it.

I knew I needed a strategic change.

I turned back to my teenage hobby: computers. I had always loved the tactile process of breaking things, figuring out why they broke, and repairing them. I decided to turn that curiosity into a career.

## Going Deep: From Help Desk to Founder
I started from scratch. My path took me from the Help Desk, to the trenches of Linux System Administration , and finally to founding my own IT service provider agency, Evrin (Dayan Abr Evrin) .

I went deep. I spent over 14 years mastering the intersection of Linux systems and infrastructure . I didn't just want to be a "maintainer"—I wanted to be a problem solver. My background in system administration meant I understood what happens "under the hood" when a service fails.

I built a comfortable life. I had a thriving business, a good income, and loyal customers. But eventually, I hit a wall.

## Leaving the Comfort Zone
I realized I was working in a place that was isolated from the global technology ecosystem. I found myself solving the same problems over and over again, purely for money, without facing real technical challenges. The "discovery" aspect that I loved in those Physics labs was gone.

I knew I had to leave my comfort zone to grow.

So, Finally, I made the decision to relocate from Iran to Istanbul, Turkey. It wasn't an easy decision, I traded a stable, predictable life for the opportunity to tackle global-scale challenges in Cloud and DevOps.

## The Architect of Order
To fully commit to this new chapter, I am not just relying on my past experience. I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Engineering in Istanbul. This academic pursuit allows me to formalize the hands-on knowledge I’ve gained over the last decade, bridging the gap between practical engineering and advanced computer science theory.

## My Technical Toolkit:

- **Cloud**: Microsoft Azure, AWS
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform, Ansible
- **Containerization**: Docker, Kubernetes
- **Observability**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack

## The "Active-Active" Cluster at Home
I didn’t make this journey alone. My ability to take these risks comes from the support of my wife, who has stood by me through every transition. Together, we are raising our twin boys.

I often joke that while I spend my days ensuring high availability for Cloud environments, I manage a very different type of "active-active" cluster at home with my sons. They have taught me more about crisis management and patience than any server outage ever could.

I am currently based in Istanbul and open to full-time opportunities where I can help build the infrastructure of tomorrow.
